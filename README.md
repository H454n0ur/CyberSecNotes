# ðŸ•· About

I'm Th4ntis(Damian), a cyber security and information security enthusiast. I do this as a career and as a hobby. I've put this together to document my notes, as well as my steps and walkthroughs for CTFs and hands-on labs.&#x20;

There will be pages with little to no content as this is and will be a work in progress for a while as some as placeholders as a reminder to update them, others will be updated as I move my personal notes over to here. This will updated as I learn more about various tools, trades, methods, you name it.

Keep an eye at the bottom of this page where I put what was most recently updated. Any and all suggestions welcome.
