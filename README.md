# About

I'm Th4ntis, a cyber security and information security enthusiast. I do this as a career and as a hobby. I've put this together to document my notes, as well as my steps and walkthroughs for CTFs and hands-on labs.&#x20;

There will be pages with little to no content as this is and will be a work in progress for a while as some as placeholders as a reminder to update them, others will be updated as I move my personal notes over to here. This will updated as I learn more about various tools, trades, methods, you name it.

Any and all suggestions welcome.

**Note:** I do not claim any copyrighted content. Any of the tools or methods here are for reference, research, and educational purposes only and not to be used for unethical, questionable or illegal activities.
