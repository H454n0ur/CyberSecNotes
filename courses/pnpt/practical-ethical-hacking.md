# Practical Ethical Hacking

## Networking Refresher

I used my own notes on these subjects, added some of Heaths notes.

[Networking](../../networking/) - [TCP, UDP, 3-Way Handshake](../../networking/3-way-handshake.md) - [OSI Model](../../networking/osi-model.md) - [Common Ports](../../networking/common-ports-and-protocols.md) - [Subnetting](../../networking/subnetting.md)

## Intro to Linux

### Lab Setup

The previous section was setting up Kali, [I've done this prior](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/kali-vm.md) so I skipped this section.

I used the [pre-made VM](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) (using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract it) using the VMWare Pro software.

### Intro to Linux

[I've worked with Linux prior to this](../../linux/), so I have my own notes on these sections as well:

[Common Commands](../../linux/common-commands.md) - [Permissions](../../linux/permissions.md) - [Sudo](../../linux/sudo.md) - [Files and File contents](../../linux/files-and-file-contents.md)

### Scripting with Bash

## Intro to Python

## The Ethical Hacker Methodology

## Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)

I have a section on [OSINT](../../osint/) and [OSINT tools/methods](../../osint/osint-tools.md) here.

## Scanning and Enumeration

As I have worked with these tools prior, I have other notes here as well.

[Nmap](../../networking/nmap.md) - [Dirb/Dirbuster](../../tools/enumeration/dirb-dirbuster.md) - [GoBuster](../../tools/enumeration/gobuster.md) - [Metasploit](../../tools/exploitation-framework/metasploit.md)

## Vuln Scanning with Nessus

As I have worked with Nessus prior, my notes in general can be found [here](../../tools/vulnerability-scanners/nessus.md).

## Active Directory Overview

For their lab you will need roughly:

* 1x Win Server
* 2x Windows Workstations
* 60GB Disk Space
* 16GB RAM

There is a Cloud Alternative by Kamran Bilgrami that can be found here: [Building Free Active Directory Lab in Azure](https://kamran-bilgrami.medium.com/ethical-hacking-lessons-building-free-active-directory-lab-in-azure-6c67a7eddd7f)

I have done this in the past so my notes and setup can be found: [Lab Setup](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/)

[Windows Server VM](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/windows-server-vm.md) - [Windows User VM](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/windows-user-vm.md)

## Attacking AD: Initial Attack Vectors

COMING SOON!
