# Getting Started and other Resources

## TryHackMe

A great place to start is [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). I can't recommend it enough. It's a resource that has a lot of free rooms and paths, as well as CTF's(Capture The Flag) but if you want to upgrade is very affordable and unlocks a lot more. First is the Complete [Beginner path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner). This will cover how to get started using TryHackMe, their VPN or in browser machine. There is a good path called [Pre Security](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity). This will go over intros to Offensive and Defensive Security, various Careers within CyberSec, and more. Overall TryHackMe if a great place to start as it is hands on. It allows you to use your own VirtualMachine (VM) or if you don't have that ability or don't know how to yet, you can use [their in browser machine](https://tryhackme.com/my-machine) to do everything from.

If you would like to know more on setting up VMs, I have [guides here](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/).

My recommendations for beginner TryHackMe modules are:

* [Intro to CyberSecurity](https://tryhackme.com/module/introduction-to-cyber-security)
* [Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)
* [Windows Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/windows-fundamentals)
* [Linux Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals)
* [How The Web Works](https://tryhackme.com/module/how-the-web-works)
* [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/module/nmap)

## HackTheBox

[HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/) is a great place to go after you feel comfortable with what you have ;earned from TryHackMe. They have more CTFs but also offer their learning platform [HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/). Similar to TryHackMe you can run it in your own VirtualMachine(VM) or they offer an in browser machine to use as well.
