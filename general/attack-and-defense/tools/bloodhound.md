## Install

Pre-Compiled binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases)

Add the neo4j repo to your apt sources (Echoing this out kept fighting me so I nano'd the file myself)

```bash
wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable 4.4' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
```

Install apt-transport-https and neo4j

```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https neo4j
```

Ensure Neo4j runs properly. Stop the service, manually start it and verify no issues prevent it from running

```bash
sudo systemctl stop neo4j
cd /usr/bin
sudo ./neo4j console
```

If it start properly, start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl start neo4j
```

Once started, go to: [http://localhost:7474/](https://localhost:7474/) log in with neo4j:neo4j, change the password when prompted.

Once we have that started, download a Pre-Compiled binary from [here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases). From inside the unzipped folder we can start Bloodhound.

```bash
sudo ./BloodHound.bin --no-sandbox
```
