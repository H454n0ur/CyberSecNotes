# CyberSec News

Keeping up with various Cyber/Information Security can be done through various Social media, such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [Reddit](https://reddit.com), or RSS Feeds. With some of the platforms dying or just going down hill, I wanted to show places of ways to get updates in the Cyber/Information Security world.

## Reddit

[Reddit](https://reddit.com) works, it just depends on which Subreddit you follow, since anyone can make a post at any time so it can be flooded with people asking questions or nonsense. So it dependso n the moderators or bots to kind of keep things cleaned up. Some of the various subreddits I follow are:

* [r/CyberSecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/)
* [r/Privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/)
* [r/PrivacyGuides](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/)
* [r/OpSec](https://www.reddit.com/r/opsec/)

Though there are plenty of others, there's a subreddit for just about anything/everything.

## Twitter

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) is where a large things are posted often and first, but as of recently it's been on a downslope and more so after various rumors of it being you need to pay to use it. People and groups I follow include:

* [@vxunderground](https://twitter.com/vxunderground)
* [@packet\_storm](https://twitter.com/packet\_storm)
* [@DailtOsint](https://twitter.com/DailyOsint)
* [@OSINTIndustries](https://twitter.com/OSINTindustries)
* [@hackingarticles](https://twitter.com/hackinarticles)
* [@TrustedSec](https://twitter.com/TrustedSec)

and plnety of others.

## RSS Readers

[Feedly](https://feedly.com) - A go to one as it's via the web and has a mobile app, can follow Reddit on there as well, and others. Though some features of behind a paywall but the free version works great.

[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) - Linux based terminal RSS Reader.
