# Security+

The [Comptia Security+(SY0-601](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)). "A global certification that validates the baseline skills necessary to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career."

I recommend [Jason Dions course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/). This course was updated in May of 2023.

Broken into 5 'Domains'

* Domain 1 - Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities - 24%
* Domain 2 - Architecture and Design - 21%
* Domain 3 - Implementation - 25%
* Domain 4 - Operations and Incident Response - 16%
* Domain 5 - Governance, Risk, and Compliance - 14%

Like most Comptia exams, you will have 165 min to answer **up to** 90 questions, can be 70-90. Questions are multiple choice, multiple select, and a small Performance Based Questions(Simulations) and drag and drop them in the proper order. **Usually** exams are: 3-5 Simulations, 80-85 multiple choice, but this can vary. You need 750 out of 900 points(80-85%) to pass.
