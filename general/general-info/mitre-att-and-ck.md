# MITRE ATT\&CK

MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT\&CK) is a knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary's attack cycle and the platforms they are known to target.

The tactics and techniques in the model provide a common principle of individual adversary actions understood by both offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity. It also provides an appropriate level of categorization for adversary action and specific ways of defending against it.

From their homepage: "MITRE ATT\&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT\&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community."
