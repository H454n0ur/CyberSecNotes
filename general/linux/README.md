# üêß Linux

This is my notes on the linux OS and will cover commands and configs. I personally use [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) ([Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) but with KDE as opposed the default Gnome desktop environment.) as it is lightweight, has a lot customization options and just works with little to no issues from my experience.

### Popular Linux Distros (In no particular order):

* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
* [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
* [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
* [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
