# Dot files

User-specific application configuration is traditionally stored in so called dotfiles (files that the filename starts with a dot). It's a good idea to track dotfiles with a version control system such as Git to keep track of changes and synchronize dotfiles across various hosts or for backup. A lot of users backup their shell configs, vim config, tmux config, etc.

A link to my dot files can be found [here on my github](https://github.com/Th4ntis/dotfiles). There are plenty of other [dotfile topics](https://github.com/topics/dotfiles) on github as well.
