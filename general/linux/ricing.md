# Ricing

"Ricing" is a process in which one customizes a computer operating system to improve the look or operation of the system. It involves the configuration of applications and the development and refining of workflows. In my opinion, to rice your Linux flavor should start with your Desktop Environment(DE) or Window Manager(WM). The [r/unixporn subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) is great for finding ideas.

I personally have found [KDE](https://kde.org/), or [XFCE](https://xfce.org/) desktop environments are the most customizable with ease. You can use things like [Krohnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite) on KDE to help as well instead of going full in with a WM.

WMs such as [i3](https://i3wm.org/), [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), or [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/index.html) are great, but WMs can be difficult to customize so make sure you back up your configs often.
