# ðŸ’» Networking

This will be my notes on networking, covering the basics and details that I feel most everyone should grasp and understand.

## Mac Addresses:

A Mac Address is a physical address and have identifiers, and is on layer 2 of the OSI Model. An example MAC Address 00:0c:29:0a:42:05. If you look up the first 3 sets in a MAC Address Lookup, you can find the vendor of that hardware that has that MAC Address. Eg. 00:0c:29 comes up with VMWare Inc. as that is part of the MAC address of my VM.

MAC = Media Access Control
