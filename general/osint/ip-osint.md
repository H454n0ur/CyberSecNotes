# IP OSINT

When researching IP addresses, it is important we know the context of the search we are performing. There are a multitude of sources to research IP addresses and they can vary depending on what information we want to learn about them.&#x20;

For offensive security, threat hunting, and attack surface mapping, we want current registration data, and any associated data points that our searches may return. These can include hosted domains, ASN, associated network artifacts, etc.

For defensive operations, such as those of the security blue team, we are looking for historical data and activity data of the IP address.

## Tools

* [RDAP](https://client.rdap.org/) - **Registration Data Access Protocol** is the successor to WHOIS. Like WHOIS, RDAP provides access to information about Internet resources (domain names, autonomous systems, and IP addresses). Unlike WHOIS, RDAP provides:
  * A machine-readable representation of registration data;
  * Differentiated access;
  * Structured request and response semantics;
  * Internationalisation;
  * Extensibility.
* [Whois](https://www.whois.com/whois) - A Whois domain lookup allows you to trace the ownership and tenure of a domain name.
* [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) - Shodan is a search engine that lets users search for various types of servers connected to the internet using a variety of filters.
* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) - Analyze suspicious files, domains, IPs and URLs to detect malware and other breaches, automatically share them with the security community
* [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) - AbuseIPDB is a project dedicated to helping combat the spread of hackers, spammers, and abusive activity on the internet.
* [IBM X-Force](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/) - Threat intelligence sharing platform enabling research on security threats, aggregation of intelligence, and collaboration with peers
* [IPVoid](https://www.ipvoid.com/)
