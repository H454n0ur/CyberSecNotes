# Nessus

## About

[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is a vulnerability scanner from Tenable. Nessus can be deployed on most system, including Raspberry Pi for portability. Can be downloaded form [here](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true), but does require you to make an account to receive a license. On the free account you can scan up to 16 IPs.

So typically when using it for your own environment you want to use the same machines _OR_ set different machines to same IPs you had previously scanned.
