# Windows

Here are my notes for the Windows OS. Most of my testing against Windows 10 at the moment. I use [Windows 10 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) and [Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019). We can download Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/) if we want as well.
