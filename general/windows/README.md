# Windows

These are my notes on the Windows OS. I typically test on/against [Windows 10 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) and [Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019). There are other evaluation ISOs found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/) on Microsoft website, such as Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.
