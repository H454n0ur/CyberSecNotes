# ðŸ“¦ HackTheBox

[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) is a way to learn and practice various aspects of Cyber Security with labs through hands on experience using your own machine and connect to their network via an [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) file.

They even have an [academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue) that has courses for learning.

The main differences are "Hack The Box is a training platform, HTB Academy is a learning one."

"HTB Academy is cybersecurity learning the HTB way! An effort to gather everything we have learned over the years, meet our community's needs and create a "University for Hackers," where our users can learn step-by-step the cybersecurity theory and get ready for the training playground of HTB, our labs. All the way from guided to exploratory learning, learn how to hack and develop the hacking mindset that will enable you to assess and create secure systems. HTB Academy's goal is to provide a highly interactive and streamlined learning process to allow users to have fun while learning. Students are presented with material in digestible chunks with examples of commands and their output throughout, not just theory. Target hosts are provided so students can reproduce the materials presented in each section for themselves. There are hands-on exercises that serve as "checkpoints", and skills assessments to test students' understanding of the Module content."
