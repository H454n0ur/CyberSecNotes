# eJPT

## W**ork In Progress!**

The [eJPT(eLearnSecurity Jr. Penetration Tester)](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/61f88d91-79ff-4d8f-af68-873883dbbd8c/penetration-testing-student-v2) by INE "validates that the individual has the knowledge and skills required to fulfill a role as an entry-level penetration tester.". This is a great beginner cert for anyone looking to get into Pentesting from [Josh Mason](https://ine.com/learning/instructors/josh-mason) and Alexis Ahmed([@hackersploit](https://twitter.com/HackerSploit))

Rather than have each one in it's own section, I will have my notes here in a PDF for viewing/downloading.

### Notekeeping tools

I'm using Jopin for offline notes and uploading the PDFs of each section here, then obviously, Gitbook.

Others are: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - [CheryTree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/) - [OneNote](https://products.office.com/en-us/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?rtc=1)

### Screenshot tools

I'm using [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) on Windows, and [FlameShot](https://github.com/lupoDharkael/flameshot) Linux(Ubuntu). Another option on windows is [GreenShot](https://getgreenshot.org/downloads/).
