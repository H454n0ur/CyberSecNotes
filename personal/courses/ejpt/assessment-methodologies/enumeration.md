## Servers and Services

### Server

A server serves something for a user. Provides a functionality from that machine to be used by other devices. Servers run Linux, Windows or MacOS. A server may have a keyboard, monitor and mouse directly attached, or one keyboard, monitor and mouse may connect to any number of servers via a KVM switch. In datacenters with hundreds and thousands of servers residing in equipment racks, all access is via the network.

Stand-alone PCs can also function as a server to other users on the network even though they serve as a single workstation to one user. In such cases, specific folders are typically configured for sharing rather than the entire hard drive.

### Services

A service is functionality derived by running software. Eg. network services may refer to programs that analyze data or provide the conversion of data transmitting in a network. Database services store and retrieve data in a database. Web services add functionality to websites
