# Microsoft SC-200

This will be my notes for the [Microsoft SC-200](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-200/). They have a [study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/resources/study-guides/SC-200), and [videos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/exam-readiness-zone/preparing-for-sc-200-mitigate-threats-using-microsoft-365-defender-1-of-3), but I will be going through [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/sc-200-microsoft-security-operations-analyst-exam-prep/).

There are ways to go through this from Microsoft as well using the [Self-Paced path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-200/?tab=tab-learning-paths) or the [Instructor led path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-200/?tab=tab-instructor-led).

You can schedule the exam and take it on your own machine via PearsonVUE or find a local testing center. You will need a score of minimum 700 to pass.

From the [SC-200 page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-200/): "Microsoft security operations analysts reduce organizational risk by rapidly remediating active attacks in the environment, advising on improvements to threat protection practices, and referring violations of organizational policies to appropriate stakeholders. They perform triage, incident response, vulnerability management, threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence analysis.

Microsoft security operations analysts monitor, identify, investigate, and respond to threats in multicloud environments by using Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft 365 Defender, and third-party security solutions. Microsoft security operations analysts collaborate with business stakeholders, architects, identity administrators, Azure administrators, and endpoint administrators to secure IT systems for the organization.

Candidates should be familiar with Microsoft 365, Azure cloud services, and Windows and Linux operating systems."
