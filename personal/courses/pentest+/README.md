Like most Comptia exams, you will have 165 min to answer **up to** 90 questions, can be 70-90. Questions are multiple choice, multiple select, and a small Performance Based Questions(Simulations) and drag and drop them in the proper order. **Usually** exams are: 3-5 Simulations, 80-85 multiple choice, but this can vary. You need 750 out of 900 points(80-85%) to pass.
