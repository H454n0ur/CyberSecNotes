## Networking Refresher

I used my own notes on these subjects, added some of Heaths notes.

[IP Addresses](../../general/networking/ipv4-and-ipv6.md) - [MAC Addresses](../../general/networking/mac-addresses.md) - [TCP, UDP, 3-Way Handshake](../../general/networking/3-way-handshake.md) - [OSI Model](../../general/networking/osi-model.md) - [Common Ports](../../general/networking/common-ports-and-protocols.md) - [Subnetting](../../general/networking/subnetting.md)

## Intro to Linux

### Lab Setup

The previous section was setting up Kali, [I've done this prior](../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/kali-vm.md) so I skipped this section.

I used the [pre-made VM](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) (using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract it) using the VMWare Pro software.

### Into to Linux

[I've worked with Linux prior to this](../../general/linux/), so I have my own notes on these sections as well:

[Common Commands](../../general/linux/common-commands.md) - [Permissions](../../general/linux/permissions.md) - [Sudo](../../general/linux/sudo.md) - [Files and File contents](../../general/linux/files-and-file-contents.md)

### Scripting with Bash

## Intro to Python
