# PNPT

## Intro

This will be my botes on the TCM Security PNPT courses:&#x20;

* Practical Ethical Hacking
* Windows Privilege Escalation
* Linux Privilege Escalation
* Open-Source Intelligence
* External Pentest Playbook

Rather than have each one in it's own section, I will have my notes here in a PDF for viewing/downloading.
