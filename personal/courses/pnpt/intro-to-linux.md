# Intro to Linux

## Lab Setup

The previous section was setting up Kali, [I've done this prior](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/kali-vm.md) so I skipped this section.

I used the [pre-made VM](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) (using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract it) using the VMWare Pro software.

## Into to Linux

[I've worked with Linux prior to this](../../../general/linux/), so I have my own notes on these sections as well:

[Common Commands](../../../general/linux/common-commands.md) - [Permissions](../../../general/linux/permissions.md) - [Sudo](../../../general/linux/sudo.md) - [Files and File contents](../../../general/linux/files-and-file-contents.md)

### Scripting with Bash
