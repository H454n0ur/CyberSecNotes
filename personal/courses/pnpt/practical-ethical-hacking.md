# Practical Ethical Hacking

## Networking Refresher

I used my own notes on these subjects, added some of Heaths notes.

[Networking](../../../general/networking/) - [TCP, UDP, 3-Way Handshake](../../../general/networking/3-way-handshake.md) - [OSI Model](../../../general/networking/osi-model.md) - [Common Ports](../../../general/networking/common-ports-and-protocols.md) - [Subnetting](../../../general/networking/subnetting.md)

## Intro to Linux

### Lab Setup

The previous section was setting up Kali, [I've done this prior](../../guides-and-how-tos/lab-setup/kali-vm.md) so I skipped this section.

I used the [pre-made VM](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) (using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract it) using the VMWare Pro software.

### Into to Linux

[I've worked with Linux prior to this](../../../general/linux/), so I have my own notes on these sections as well:

[Common Commands](../../../general/linux/common-commands.md) - [Permissions](../../../general/linux/permissions.md) - [Sudo](../../../general/linux/sudo.md) - [Files and File contents](../../../general/linux/files-and-file-contents.md)

## Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)

I have a section on [OSINT](../../../general/osint/) and [OSINT tools/methods](../../../general/osint/osint-tools.md) here.

## Scanning and Enumeration

As I have worked with these tools prior, I have other notes here as well.

[Nmap](../../../general/networking/nmap.md) - [Dirb/Dirbuster](../../../general/tools/enumeration/dirb-dirbuster.md) - [GoBuster](../../../general/tools/enumeration/gobuster.md) - [Metasploit](../../../general/tools/metasploit.md)

## Vuln Scanning with Nessus

As I have worked with Nessus prior, my notes in general can be found [here](../../../general/tools/vulnerability-scanners/nessus.md).
