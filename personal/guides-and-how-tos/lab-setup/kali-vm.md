# Kali VM

I typically prefer to install it myself([using the ISO](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images)), BUT you can grab a [pre-made VM](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) from them. I have VMWare Workstation Pro but Player works just as well. You can go with either VMWare or Virtualbox, both work and it just comes down to personal preference on the application and what you're use to.

Obviously your setup may differ depending on your system specs. I typically go with 4GB(4096 MB) of RAM per VM, 2 processors and 2 cores per processor but I am running with 32GB of RAM and an Intel i7-10750H.

If you need to, you can start with 4 or 8GB of RAM and 2 processors and 2 core per processor, for the install so it goes faster then drop it down to 2 or 4GB of RAM and 2 processors and 1 core per processor for the victim machines.
