# Staying Private and goin Dark Online

## Starting out - Creating accounts <a href="#starting-out-creating-accounts" id="starting-out-creating-accounts"></a>

1. Create a [Protonmail](https://proton.me/) account, make the email something random that isn't related to you. An alternative to Protonmail is [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/).
2. Next would be login to [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) with your Proton account. You'll be using this to create emails for individual accounts/services you'll be using and making. An alternative to SimpleLogin is [Anonaddy](https://anonaddy.com/).
3. Go to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for a Password manager. Make a new email using SimpleLogin for this, and start using this to save all your passwords/logins/and etc.
4. When making online payments use [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/). This lets you create virtual payment cards for one-time purchases or subscriptions. **NOTE:** Some services will not let you or will fight you on using these virtual cards.
5. I also HIGHLY recommend signing up for the other services Proton offers, such as their [VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) and [Drive](https://drive.proton.me/). There is usually a bundle package for email and VPN and all in one.
6. From here, when signing up for anything, use SimpleLogin to make an email for it to have it forwarded to your Proton account, saving the logins in Bitwarden, and making payments with Privacy.

## Hardware <a href="#hardware" id="hardware"></a>

1. I personally recommend a Google Pixel Phone - Unlocked, and installing [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) or [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/). iPhones are good as well though some of their privacy policies lately kinda of sketchy(Eg. Scanning iCloud pictures and such). Using [MintMobile](https://www.mintmobile.com/) instead of a normal carrier. So you'll be getting a new phone number.\
   When giving out your new phone number to family/friends, make sure you trust them to not give it out to others.
2. Most machines work but will depend on your usecase, but rather than using Windows or MacOS, go with [QuebesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) or base [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

## Software <a href="#software" id="software"></a>

1. [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) can be used to encrypt files/folder to be uploaded to cloud storage for extra security.
2. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for a Password manager.
3. [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) for File hosting.
4. [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/) Browser.
5. [Signal](https://signal.org/en/), [Element](https://element.io/), or [Session](https://getsession.org/) for chat messaging, though you will need other people on the platform as well or your message will not encrypted.
6. [MySudo](https://mysudo.com/) for creating phone numbers to use instead of your real phone number.
7. **Self host as much as possible**, such as storing your bitwarden manager and files on your own machines.
