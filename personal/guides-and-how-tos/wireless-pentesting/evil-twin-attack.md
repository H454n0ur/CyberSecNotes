This will be a walkthrough on  performing an [Evil Twin wireless attack](https://www.varonis.com/blog/evil-twin-attack) and [Captive Portals](https://www.linksys.com/what-is-a-captive-portal.html).

An evil twin is a fake wireless access point(AP) that looks like a real one. The concept is to set up a malicious wireless network with the same SSID name as the target.

This will require having a WiFi Adapter that supports monitor mode, also known as packet injection.

I myself have and recommend these adapters:

* [Alfa AWUS036ACM](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036ACM-Long-Range-Dual-Band-Wireless/dp/B073X6RL9D) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz
* [Alfa AWUS036ACHM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08SJBV1N3/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_1?smid=A20G3A026MV70R\&psc=1) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz
* [Alfa AWUS036ACH](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SJC78FH?ref\_=cm\_sw\_r\_cp\_ud\_dp\_PSZZG6J9X0XH40GXB685) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz (This more than likely \*will\* require driver installation)
* [Panda Wireless PAU09 N600](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-Wireless-PAU09-Adapter-Antennas/dp/B01LY35HGO) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz
* [Alfa AWUS036NEH](https://www.amazon.com/AWUS036NEH-Range-WIRELESS-802-11b-USBAdapter/dp/B0035OCVO6)
* [Alfa AWUS036NH](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NH-802-11g-Wireless-Long-Range/dp/B003YIFHJY)
* [Panda Wireless PAU05](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-300Mbps-Wireless-USB-Adapter/dp/B00EQT0YK2)
* [TP-Link TL-WN722N](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-TL-WN722N-Wireless-network-Adapter/dp/B002SZEOLG)
* [Ralink USB WiFi RT5370](https://www.amazon.com/Ralink-RT5370-Raspberry-Adapter-Function/dp/B019XUDHFC)

You can also use a device such as [WiFi Pineapple](https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple).



### Post connection

Once they are connected, or even before, we can start intercepting traffic with whatever tools we want, like [Wireshark](../../../general/networking/wireshark.md), [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html), [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/), etc.

We can also target WiFi with security and setup [Captive Portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive\_portal) that will require them to enter credentials for their home WiFi or a website like Google which is then given to us.
