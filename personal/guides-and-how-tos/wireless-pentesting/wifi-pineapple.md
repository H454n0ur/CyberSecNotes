# WiFi Pineapple

## Wifi Pineapple

The [WiFi Pineapple](https://shop.hak5.org/collections/wifi-pentesting/products/wifi-pineapple) is devolved by [Hak5](https://hak5.org/). Their documentation can be found [here](https://docs.hak5.org/wifi-pineapple/).

From their website: "Automate WiFi auditing with all new campaigns and get actionable results from vulnerability assessment reports. Command the airspace with a new interactive recon dashboard, and stay on-target and in-scope with the leading rogue access point suite for advanced man-in-the-middle attacks.

Next-gen network processors combine with multiple role-based radios and the Hak5 patented PineAP suite to deliver impressive results. Hardened and stress tested for the most challenging environments.

The new WiFi Pineapple Mark VII features incredible performance from a simple web interface with an expansive ecosystem of apps, automated pentest campaigns, and Cloud C2 for remote access from anywhere."

## Basic Evil Portal

I was unable to clone the repoitory to my pineapple. so I cloned them to my machine and copied them to the pineapple under `/root/portals/`. I took some of [Kleo Evil Portals](https://github.com/kleo/evilportals) as I'm not skilled enough to make my own.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Th4ntis/Evil-Portals.git
scp -r Evil-Portals/* root@172.16.42.1:/root/portals/
```

Download the Evil Portal module from the Pineapple Modules

Once installed open the module, and install dependencies. Now we can preview the portals by activating the Portal

Once activated, start the web server, then we can preview the portal.

Now, we go to our OpenAP, set the desired WiFi name, BSSID, and channel.

Start the server with the Evil Portal, now when a client is connected, on the home page we will see their MAC address and IP address.

Now when the client is connected they are sent to an authorization login page, Google in the case.&#x20;

If they enter their credentials, their page shows they aren't authorized. this can be always be modified to show whatever we may want.

We also get a notification our Pineapple page

We can view the logs from the Evil Portal page to see the email, password, hostname, MAC, and IP that put in their credentials.
