# ðŸ›  Tools

This section will cover various attack tools, vectors, methods, and how we can use them, as well as what to look for to defend against them.

Many tools can be used both offensively and defensively, so seeing one being used should not immediately indicate malicious intent. For example, [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), is a vulnerability scanner and it can be used offensively to see what services are running, what version they are running on, and if they have any immediate known vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. In the same, this can be used defensively to know what is vulnerable in your network and can tell you how to patch the vulnerability so it may not be exploited in that manor.

{% hint style="warning" %}
No one tool is a end all be all. There is no "One Tool to Rule Them All". Use multiple tools for the job. They can all do things differently and give information in various ways.

## Terminology

APT is an acronym for Advanced Persistent Threat. This can be considered a team/group (_**threat group**_), or even country (_**nation-state group**_), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries. FireEye's current list of APT groups can be found [**here**](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html).  \


TTP is an acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures:

* The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
* The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
* The Procedure is how the technique is executed.
